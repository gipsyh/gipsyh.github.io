I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), under the supervision of Professor Qiusong Yang. I received my bachelor’s degree in Marine Technology from Ocean University of China (OUC) in 2021. My research interests focus on hardware formal verification.
